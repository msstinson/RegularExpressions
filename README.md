# Notes

Available in many programming languages and text editors
* Useful for developers and power users
* Different syntax in Visual Studio

Easier to write than to read
* Comments are important
* Explain *why* you're doing what you're doing

Write pseudo code first
* Break down the logic
* Think about edge cases

Testing
* List strings that should match
* List similar strings that shouldn't match

Libraries are available online
* Don't reuse without testing
* Add comments if there aren't any

Format
* `/regex/flags`
* Regex is bracketed by slashes

Modifiers (flags)
* `i` Case insensitive
* `g` Global (don't return on first match)
* `m` Multi-line (treat each line as a separate string)
